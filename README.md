# open-source
GetThru Open Source contributions.

## Introduction
This repository contains GetThru's open source software releases, all under the Apache 2 license unless otherwise noted.

### FAQ

**Can I use or fork these projects?**

Sure! We'd love to hear about it if you do--just be sure not to change the license.

**How do I open issues?**

This is a free-as-in-free-kittens model. We have disabled the issue tracker.

**What about PRs?**

Again, free kittens. Due to our limited engineering resources, we are unlikely to service any opened PRs.

## Projects

1. *OpentelemetryDsl* in the `opentelemetry_dsl` folder is a helpful DSL for doing tracing and working with OpenTelemetry.
